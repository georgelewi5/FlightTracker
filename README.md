Flight tracker for the inkplate 10 board.

Plz don't judge my CPP, I started learning it for this project.

Pulls from flight radar and displays the closest plane to the coordinates you set. 

Made this due to living under the heathrow flight path.

Due to using an inkplate and sleep functions it should last 30+ days without needing a charge.

Main details the display shows:
